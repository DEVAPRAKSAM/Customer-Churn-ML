# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project helps to predict whether a customer will leave a company or not using machine learning. We use the Telco Customer Churn dataset and apply models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## 📁 Dataset
- Dataset used: [Telco Customer Churn - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Rows: 7043 customers
- Target column: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 📌 Objective
- Predict churn using ML models
- Understand which features affect customer retention
- Show results using graphs and performance metrics

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost

## 📊 ML Models
